# Proposed-Safety-System
4 Layer PCB using Altium Designer

Low voltage optimized for safety using STM32 microcontroller
Tasked to measure safety critical vibrations using Load Cell, further enhanced using an Accelerometer
Additional QSPI Flash with USB-to-UART option using CH340E and USB B Connector

Possible applications in Cars, Flight Systems etc
